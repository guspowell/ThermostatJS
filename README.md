Thermostat
=======================

## Introduction
In week 5 of Makers we were introduced to Javascript for the first time. The week involved making an awesome thermostat (inspired by the lack of heating at Maker's that week!).


## Brief
* Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
* You can increase the temp with the up button
* You can decrease the temp with the down button
* The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
* If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
* If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
* Power saving mode is on by default
* You can reset the temperature to 20 by hitting the reset button
* Thermostat should color the display based on energy usage - < 18 is green, < 25 is yellow, otherwise red

### Added features
* Has an away button which turns thermostat to min (or a set temperature)
* should know the current time
